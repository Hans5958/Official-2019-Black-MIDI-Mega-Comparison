# Official 2019 Black MIDI Mega Comparison
Home of the official 2019 Black MIDI mega comparison. Please check this doc for updates every few days ***AND*** before you do your runs. Revisions may occur without prior notice. Major changes will be announced in the Discord servers.

***180*** submissions and counting! Participate today!

*The times in the repo are standardized to conform to 60fps timecode. Edits in addition to the standardization have also been made. They will **NOT** match PFA's counter. Eligibility times are based on the times reported by PFA's counter.*

## Announcement

Good news! Everyone is eligible! As I started working on the comparison, I decided to go for an x by x design. This means there are still spots!

The rules will remain the same but now, anyone can submit a run with any CPU; there are no eligibility requirements. The number of slots left are tracked below. This will fill up quickly so if you want to participate, I'd advise you to get it in within the next couple of days! In the Hitotose Caf√©, first come is first served.

IMPORTANT: If your run was previously ineligible, you MUST resubmit it. You are also subject to the first come first served rule. Also, you must submit runs of ALL MIDIs if you'd like to be included in the composite analysis.

**This submission period will close when all the slots have been filled or by the latest, 11/2 4:30 AM PDT.**

## Slots Left
- Tau: 2
- RST: 2
- 9KX2: 4
- TFL: 0
- Tartarus: 6
- Reptilian Dark Ritual: 1

*If you have a 6000-series or newer 4+ core Intel unlocked (K/KS/X/XE) desktop CPU not on this list, feel free to contact me.*

### Provision 2
Meet any **ONE** of the crash pt cut times below for a particular MIDI, qualify for that MIDI (per MIDI qualification).

[9KX2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7e36Yc3e3w): 2:18.3 OR 3:45.4 OR 5:49.2 <br>
[Tau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0gyQMJHQ78): 3:15.7 OR 5:42.3 <br>
[Tartarus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3QCN1qqfIo): 2:07.8 OR 3:24.0 <br>
[RST 14.6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAtk3wOlB2Y): 3:07.1 OR 4:33.2 <br>
[Reptilian Dark Ritual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBb4NPR_scM): 4:24.6* <br>
[TFL 19.4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmtiTkXcPJU): 3:13.7 OR 3:53.6 <br>

*PFA's counter is inaccurate on this MIDI so you must use a timer while running it or calculate the time yourself.*

#### Examples

Example 1: Senko is a powerful fox demigoddess and has a Ryzen 9 3900X. Since it's on the list in Provision 1, any runs she does on her 3900X qualify.

Example 2: Susu is a weak fox spirit and has an i5-2500K (OC'd to 5.5 GHz using Tosan magic). This isn't on the Provision 1 list so her 2500K doesn't qualify under Provision 1. We look to Provision 2. On her Tau run, her 2500K gets 3:12.1 and 5:45.9. Since it meets **ONE** of the times, that 2500K run qualifies (you only need to meet 1 time). This only means that her 2500K Tau run qualifies however. We'd need to see the times on her 9KX2 run to see if she qualifies for 9KX2.

## Rules

**Required**
- UNEDITED REAL-TIME FULL SCREEN RECORDINGS using ORIGINAL PFA V1.1.0 showing all 128 keys in PFA w/ audio. No camera recordings.
- 1 run per MIDI per CPU (Means you could submit 12 runs if you have 2 CPUs that are listed in Provision 1!)

**Suggested**
- Enable PFA's FPS counter
- 720p+ resolution, 60 FPS
- 0.05 note speed (0.025 for Tartarus)
- Use LoudMax
- Use black background in PFA

**Clarifications**
- Runs don't have to be new, can be old runs you did
- Advanced OCing allowed (single-core/CCX/CCD OCing, disabling cores/threads)
