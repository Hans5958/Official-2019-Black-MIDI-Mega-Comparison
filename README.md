- i3-8350K/9350K/9350KF
- i5-6600K/7600K/8600K/9600K/9600KF
- i7-6700/6700K/6800K/7700/7700K/8700/8700K/8086K/9700/9700F/9700K/9700KF
- i9-9900K/9900KF/9900KS
- i9-7900X/7920X/7940X/7960X/7980XE/9900X/9920X/9940X/9960X/9980XE
- i5-6400/6500/6600 AND i7-6700 (if @ all-core OC of 4+ GHz w/ modded BIOS)

*If you have a 6000-series or newer 4+ core Intel unlocked (K/KS/X/XE) desktop CPU not on this list, feel free to contact me.*

### Provision 2
Meet any **ONE** of the crash point cut times below for a particular MIDI to qualify for that MIDI (per MIDI qualification).

[9KX2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7e36Yc3e3w): 2:18.3 OR 3:45.4 OR 5:49.2 <br>
[Tau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0gyQMJHQ78): 3:15.7 OR 5:42.3 <br>
[Tartarus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3QCN1qqfIo): 2:07.8 OR 3:24.0 <br>
[RST 14.6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAtk3wOlB2Y): 3:07.1 OR 4:33.2 <br>
[Reptilian Dark Ritual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBb4NPR_scM): 4:24.6* <br>
[TFL 19.4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmtiTkXcPJU): 3:13.7 OR 3:53.6 <br>

*PFA's counter is inaccurate on this MIDI; you must use a timer while running it or calculate the time yourself.*

#### Examples

Example 1: Senko-san is a powerful fox demigoddess and has a Ryzen 9 3900X. Since it's on the list in Provision 1, any runs she does on her 3900X qualify automatically.

Example 2: Susu is a weak fox spirit and has an i5-2500K (OC'd to 5.5 GHz using Tosan magic). This isn't on the Provision 1 list so her 2500K doesn't qualify under Provision 1. We look to Provision 2. On her Tau run, her 2500K gets 3:12.1 and 5:45.9. Since it meets **ONE** of the times, that 2500K run qualifies (you only need to meet one time). However, this only means that her 2500K is qualified for Tau. We'd need to see the times on her 9KX2 run to see if she qualifies for 9KX2.

## Rules

**Required**
- UNEDITED REAL-TIME FULL SCREEN RECORDINGS using ORIGINAL PFA V1.1.0 showing all 128 keys in PFA w/ audio. No camera recordings.

**Suggested**
- 720p+ resolution, 60 FPS
- 0.05 note speed (0.025 for Tartarus)
- PFA's FPS counter enabled
- LoudMax
- Black background

**Clarifications**
- Runs don't have to be new; they can be old runs you did
- Advanced OCing is allowed (single-core/CCX/CCD OC, disabled cores/threads)
