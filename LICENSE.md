### Terms

By entering a submission into this comparison, you agree to all of the following:
- You affirm you have all rights to the videos you submit.
- You allow MusiMasta to download your video for the purpose of usage in the comparison.
- You allow the usage of your video and its corresponding identification info and benchmark results in the comparison video on YouTube (which will be unmonetized*); spreadsheet, graphs, and audio which will be publicly available in this Github repository; and occasional previews and surveys hosted on my other YouTube channels, Discord servers, and Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter accounts.

You acknowledge that:
- Runs may be rejected for any reason but there will always be a follow-up response detailing why.
- The status of this comparison (whether it occurs and how many MIDIs it ends up covering) will depend on the number of people who participate.

**Note: You may use any of the files in this fork in your own projects and videos for noncommercial uses if you appropriately credit me in the description. Appropriate credit includes my name, "MusiMasta", and my [YouTube channel link](https://www.youtube.com/c/MusiMasta).**

*The comparison video will be unmonetized on my end. However, some of the MIDIs are of songs that have legal third-party claimants. I will edit the video description detailing what has been claimed if such a claim arises.
